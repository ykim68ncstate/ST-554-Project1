## Initial Work (due Wednesday, 2/18) 

By the end of the day on Wednesday, 2/18, each member of the group will have a mostly complete to complete Google Colab Notebook upload within their task folder. Please change the sharing settings so others can access the Notebook. 

**Note: You should save your google Colab document in gitHub as you work. Failure to show consistent updating of the notebook may result in a deduction of that member's points.**

The README.md files in each task folder exist for you to provide feedback. You are welcome to do this live in a zoom, on slack, discord, in-person meeting, etc. Feedback notes should still be placed in that section, regardless of how feedback is given to your partner. 


## (Initial) Feedback (due Friday, 2/20)

By the end of the day on Thursday, 2/20, each member should provide feedback to the other two members in their corresponding task folder README.md document.

## (Soft) Project Submission Date or Additional Feedback (due Monday, 2/23)

By the end of the day on Monday, 2/24, each member should submit the link to this repo on the Moodle page. If more group feedback is requested, please have that done by Monday evening. Communicate clearly with your group during this process. Again, document this in the task folder README.md. 

**Note: You should save your google Colab document in gitHub as you work. Failure to show consistent updating of the notebook may result in a deduction of that member's points.**

## (Hard) Project Submission Date (due Wednesday, 2/25)
