## Task Leads (due Tuesday, 2/10)

By the end of the day on Tuesday, 2/10 each member of the group should agree to do one of the tasks of the project. Place the name of each group member next to the task

- Task 1: 
- Task 2: 
- Task 3: 

Other group notes for this item:



## Initial Work (due Monday, 2/16) 

By the end of the day on Monday, 2/16 each member of the group will have a mostly complete to complete Google Colab Notebook upload within their task folder. Please change the sharing settings so others can access the Notebook. 

**Note: You should save your google Colab document in gitHub as you work. Failure to show consistent updating of the notebook may result in a deduction of that member's points.**

The README.md files in each task folder exist for you to provide feedback. You are welcome to do this live in a zoom, on slack, discord, in-person meeting, etc. Feedback notes should still be placed in that section, regardless of how feedback is given to your partner. 

If an additional day is needed, feel free to complete this by Tuesday evening (although this is a wellness day). 


## (Initial) Feedback (due Thursday, 2/19)

By the end of the day on Thursday, 2/19, each member should provide feedback to the other two members in their corresponding task folder README.md document.

If you work on the project on F/Sat/Sun and feel like you need more feedback please request that from your teammates. They are not required to give this feedback but part of everyone's overall grade on the project relies on all three tasks.

## (Soft) Project Submission Date or additional feedback (due Monday, 2/24)

By the end of the day on Monday, 2/24, each member should submit the link to this repo on the Moodle page. If more group feedback is requested, please have that done by Monday evening. Again, document this in the task folder README.md

## (Hard) Project Submission Date (due Wednesday, 2/26)

The link should already be submitted by Monday. No more edits to documents should be made after this date!
